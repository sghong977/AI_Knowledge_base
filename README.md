# Main Page.

### This is my knowledge base related to my Computer Vision and Deep Learning projects.

I'm going to revise my private notion pages and organize them here :sunglasses:



### It would be helpful if you are...

* a beginner wonder about someone else's **research** **experience**
* Or a researcher who are doing **similar tasks** to me



### **Contents**

**Image**

* Image Classification (image encoder, backbone)
* Segmentation (semantic, panoptic, instance)
* Object Detection
* Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
* 3D Vision & SLAM
* Optical Character Recognition

**Video**

* Action Recognition
* Temporal Localization
* Action Detection

**Others**

* Deep Active Learning
* Neural Architecture Search



For each topic, the section will be divided into survey and project parts.
